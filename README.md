###**Weather App**
### **Overview**

This project is a weather forecasting web application that dynamically displays real-time weather data for any city entered by the user. It fetches current weather details using the OpenWeatherMap API and presents them through a clean, user-friendly React interface.



### **Problem**

Checking weather conditions for different cities usually requires switching between apps or websites. Thereâ€™s also a need for a quick, minimal interface where users can get temperature, condition (like sunny or rainy), and location data instantly.



### **Proposed Solution**

This app allows users to simply type a city name and get its live weather forecast, including temperature, condition type, and icons representing the weather. It provides an interactive UI with modern styling and shows accurate results by calling a real-time weather API.

### **Key Features**

- **Live Weather Data**: Pulls current temperature and weather conditions using OpenWeatherMap.
- **City Search**: Users can search any city across the globe.
- **Date Display**: Shows current date alongside weather data.
- **Weather Icons**: Displays matching weather icons (e.g., rain, sun, clouds) for better understanding.
- **Error Handling**: Alerts if the city name is incorrect or data cannot be fetched.
- **Responsive UI**: Styled using CSS with background images and form animations for visual appeal.


### **Tech Stack**

| Layer      | Technology Used                            |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Frontend   | React.js, JSX, CSS                          |
| API        | OpenWeatherMap API                          |
| Styling    | Pure CSS with responsive layout and icons   |



### **How It Works**

1. User sees a default city's weather (e.g., Islamabad) on page load.
2. User types any city name in the search field.
3. On clicking "Get", the app sends a request to the weather API.
4. The data is displayed with temperature, weather type, date, and a corresponding icon.
5. Errors are handled gracefully with alerts.


### **Conclusion**

This weather app provides a clean and efficient way to access live weather updates for any city. It's a great blend of React's interactivity and clean visual presentation using CSS, ideal for learning and demonstrating real-world API integration in frontend development.
